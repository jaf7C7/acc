# TODO

- [x] Does the application return 1 if no args are passed?
- [x] Does `date` return `1970-01-01\n` to stdout?
- [x] Does `date` return 0 args are not `None`?
- [x] Can the application set and get the date?
- [x] Does `date --advance N` advance the date by `N` days??
- [x] Does `date --advance` default to 1 day?
- [x] Does `ledger` return `superpy_ledger.csv`
- [x] Can the application set and get the ledger path?
- [x] Rewrite argument parsing using `argparse`
- [x] `date <date>` fails if `<date>` is not YYYY-MM-DD ISO format
- [x] `date --advance <days>` fails if `<days>` is not an integer
- [x] Can the application remember and recall a sequence of simple transactions?
- [x] Refactoring!
- [x] Do `set_date` and `set_ledger` reset each other?
- [x] Get test coverage up to 100%
- [x] Does `report` fail if there`s no ledger file?
- [x] Refactoring
- [x] CSV file formats
- [x] Output formatting
- [x] Clean up git history
- [x] OOP-ify
- [x] Tests should invoke a separate application instance for each command
- [x] Add `__repr__` to classes
- [X] Helpful error messages
- [x] Decide a ledger format which can record purchases and sales
- [x] Can the user sell items as well as buying them?
- [x] Report profit
- [x] Redesign ledger format (need to use double-entry bookkeeping)
- [x] Refactor report methods
- [x] Ledger, Transaction and Product objects to simplify business logic
- [x] Remove unnecessary dependencies on datetime and Ledger from Config
- [x] from datetime import date as Date daydelta => DayDelta
- [x] Get rid of @property date and ledger (and setters), and _date and _ledger, just do: self.date = args.date, self.config.write(self.__dict__.values())
- [x] simplify __repr__() on all?
- [x] Transaction should be a short-lived dict internal to Ledger and NOT a class
- [x] DictReader : fieldnames optional (read from first line of file, so write a header)
- [x] Ledger.__iter__() should yield from csv.DictReader(f, fieldnames=self.fieldnames)
- [x] Add doc strings
- [x] Refactor 'run': Let parse_args choose the function to be called
  * See <https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#other-utilities>
- [x] Add Config object
- [x] Refactor Ledger object
- [x] Add doc strings
- [x] Add type hints (see https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
- [x] Change ledger format to match <./transactions.csv>
- [x] Refactor balance method
- [x] Refactor tests (watch https://youtu.be/W40mpZP9xQQ)
- [x] Make command-line options and arguments consistent with ledger format
- [ ] Remove duplication of config and ledger paths in application and tests
- [ ] Use a namedtuple for transaction
- [ ] Rethink application use-case (implement double-entry accounting for a small business?)
  * e.g. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoVxJ4JwMtM>

- [ ] Report over a range of dates
- [ ] Add documentation
- [ ] Add README.md
